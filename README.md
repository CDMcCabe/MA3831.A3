(Horror) Fiction Writer NLP Project

This project is a prototype Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning investigation into text generation using Keras and Long Short-Term Memory word vs character mapping models. The selected corpus is a collection of online, user-submitted short-form horror fiction known as 'Creepypastas'. 

A corpus of 6016 stories from [creepypasta.com](creepypasta.com) can be downloaded using [2.WebCrawler.ipynb](2.WebCrawler.ipynb). The models utilizing the corpus, character and word mapping can be found at [3.a.Prototype_NLP-char_embedding_printout.ipynb](3.a.Prototype_NLP-char_embedding_printout.ipynb) and [3.b.Prototype_NLP-word_embedding_model.ipynb](3.b.Prototype_NLP-word_embedding_model.ipynb) respectively.
